              Hello! Welcome to your ACL Rehabilitation improvement program :)
              This device tracks your movement to monitor your balance and sway.
              Seen in the "Pateint" tab, the plots represent your balance
              comparing your injured leg versus your non-injured leg. The
              greater deviation you sway around the origin (0,0), the larger the
              range of data points will be plotted on the graphs. The closer the
              data collected is to the origin, the closer you are to a stronger
              and improved ACL. You will be indicated when the standard
              deviation of your data becomes more narrow and that you have
              improved since your last session of completing the exercises. The
              exercises you will complete are included in the device
              manual.There is also a tab for your clinician to look at your
              performance which will display a variety of plots for them to
              analyze. Please complete each exercise as indicated on both legs.
              The goal of this device is to help you with your rehabilitation
              process in regaining all range of motion in your injured leg. Your
              improvement begins here!
